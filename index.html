    <p> Tim Hill walks 3 to 4 miles every morning on 55th Street between Lexington and Third Avenue in Manhattan and has strong feelings about cyclists and cars in bike lanes in midtown. </p>


    <p> "I just feel like it's so totally out of control ... [bicyclist, scooterist, everybody] run lights … it's so out of control it feels like I am living out one of these post-apocalyptic movies," he said. </p>

    <p> During the September 28, 2022, Manhattan Community Board 5's Budget, Education & City
    Services committee meeting, July Yang, who serves on the budget, education, and city services
    committee posed the question, "How can we enforce bike lane rules, so that our pedestrians can
    walk across the street without looking 360 degrees?" </p>

    <p> Members of the board responded by arguing that pedestrian safety in bike lanes against cars and cyclstt should be a key component in the mayor's preliminary budget.   </p>

      <p> According to NYC Crash Mapper, the number of pedestrians fatalities that occured in a car crash has always been less than cyclists in Manhattan community district 5. In Manhattan community district 5, seven pedestrians died in 2012 compared to zero cyclists. In 2016, the number of pedestrians' death fell to two until 2017, and in 2017, the number of deaths of cyclists and pedestrians spiked. According to NYC Crash Mapper, four pedestrians, two more than the previous year, died, and for the first time, two cyclists died. </p>

        
    <p> In 2018, Mayor de Blasio created a $58.4 million plan called the "Green Wave: A Plan for Cycling in New York City" that installed 29.5 miles of protective bike lanes. This year, the number of facilities among pedestrians and cyclists that were hit by an automoblie was zero in Manhattan community district 5.  </p>
      
   <p>  This year two years after Mayor de Blasio launched his plan, the number of pedestrians deaths has increased to two while one cyclist died this year in Manhattan community district 5. </p>

     <p> Although fewer cyclists have died than pedestrians in a car crash, many cyclists believe that the community board does not invest in their safety.  </p>
         
   

    <p>  Andrew Poretz, who has been riding bikes in New York City since 1985, says that the safety of bike riding has only gotten worse, especially when it comes to pedestrians walking into bike lanes. He says, "pedestrians in bikes lanes, including those walking into them from parked cars in the parking lanes, are probably the biggest challenge" when biking. </p>
    <p>  To improve pedestrian safety, he suggests that people watch "an animated PSA on TV" that he watched as a kid so that they learn not to walk in the middle of bike lanes. The PSA video created by the NYS Department of Safety starts with the lyrics, "don't cross the street in the middle, middle."  </p>


      <p> Cyclist and teacher Mle Davis, who is 43-year-old and commutes to work on her bike every day on 35th street using the Sixth Avenue and Ninth Avenue bike lane, is also concerned about pedestrians stopping in the middle of the bike lanes. </p>

      <p> "I'm pretty sure that the way I'm going to die is that a pedestrian is going to step out in front of me, I'll swerve to avoid the pedestrian, and I'll be hit by a car." </p>

<p> In contrast to Mle's statement, according to NYC Crash Mapper, the number of injuries among pedestrians and cyclist tahat were in a car crash  decreased in the past years since 2013 in Manhattan community district 5. </p>
  
<p> In 2020, cyclist injuries were at their lowest since 2011, and pedestrians injuries are also at an all-time low in Manhattan community district 5. 
In 2020 and now in 2021, the injuries among cyclists and pedestrians are the same.  </p>

<p> In 2020, 125 pedestrians and 125 cyclists were injured, and in 2021, 137 pedestrians and 137 cyclists were injured, according to NYC Crash Mapper. </p>

<p> George Bargoud, a 30-year-old software developer and cyclist, argues that “a lot of pedestrians
have fully accepted cars as an integral part of the landscape. [He has] seen people not
even flinch when a car speeds past them, [but they] almost panic when a bike is slowing
down but not yet stopped a couple of meters away. "<P>
  
  <p> Cars are the biggest threat to cyclists and pedestrains. Brian Van Nieuwenhoven, a 42-year-old cyclist who serves on the Community Board 6 transportation committee, suggests that if the new mayor were to add more bike lanes to midtown, than 
    the "New Jersey barriers should be the golden standard" for the protection of both cyclists and pedestrians from cars.
