    <p> Tim Hill walks 3 to 4 miles every morning on 55th Street between Lexington and Third Avenue in Manhattan and has strong feelings about cyclists in bike lanes in midtown. </p>


    <p>  "I just feel like it's so totally out of control ... [bicyclist, scooterist, everybody] run lights … it's so out of control it feels like I am living out one of these post-apocalyptic movies," he said. </p>

    <p> During the September 28, 2022, Manhattan Community Board 5's Budget, Education & City
    Services committee meeting, July Yang, who serves on the budget, education, and city services
    committee posed the question, "How can we enforce bike lane rules, so that our pedestrians can
    walk across the street without looking 360 degrees?" </p>

    <p> Members of the board responded by arguing that pedestrian safety in bike lanes should be a key
    component in the mayor's preliminary budget. </p>

      <p> According to NYC Crash Mapper, the number of pedestrians fatalities has always been less than that of cyclist. In 2018 the year before Mayor de Blasio's his created a $58.4 million plan called the "Green Wave: A Plan for Cycling in New York City” the number of fatalities among pedestrains and cyclists was zero. Even with these low numbers, the mayor installed of 29.5 miles of protective bike lanes </p>

          <p>  Despite these statistics, many cyclists believe that community boards do not invest in their safety because they say pedestrians make bike lanes unsafe. </p>



    <p>  Andrew Poretz, who has been riding bikes in New York City since 1985, says that the safety of bike riding has only gotten worse, especially when it comes to pedestrians walking into bike lanes. He says, "pedestrians in bikes lanes, including those walking into them from parked cars in the parking lanes, are probably the biggest challenge" when biking. </p>


    <p>  To improve pedestrian safety, he suggests that people watch "an animated PSA on TV" that he watched as a kid so that they learn not to walk in the middle of bike lanes.

      The PSA video created by the NYS Department of Safety starts with the lyrics, "don't cross the street in the middle, middle." </p>


      <p> Cyclist and teacher Mle Davis, who is 43-year-old and commutes to work on her bike every day on 35th street using the Sixth Avenue and Ninth Avenue bike lane, is also concerned about pedestrians stopping in the middle of the bike lanes. </p>

      <p> "I'm pretty sure that the way I'm going to die is that a pedestrian is going to step out in front of me, I'll swerve to avoid the pedestrian, and I'll be hit by a car." </p>

<p> In contrast to Mle's statement, according to NYC Crash Mapper the number of injuries among pedestrians and cyclist have decreased in the past years since 2013. Pedestrians injuries have decaresed by 200 injuries, and has gone down from 83 injuries. </p>

<p> However, in the last two years the injuries among cyclist and pedestrians have been the same. In 2020, 125 pedestrains and 125 cyclist were injuried, and in 2021, 137 pedestrains and cyclists were injuried according to NYC Crash Mapper. </p>

      <p> As the new mayor comes in and considers Manhattan Community Board 5 concerns of pedestrian safety, there is already a difference in opinion between the Republican and Democratic candidates. Republican mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa said during Wednesday's mayoral debate that he wants to end the city's "war on vehicles" by eliminating bike lanes, while Democratic mayoral candidate Eric Adams plans to add 300 miles of protected bike lanes to NYC.

      There is, however, common ground between cyclists and pedestrians. </p>

      <p> They both believe that having protected bike lanes will make bike lanes safer for both parties. </p>


    <p>  Brian Van Nieuwenhoven, a 42-year-old cyclist who serves on the Community Board 6 transportation committee, suggests that if the new mayor were to add more bike lanes to midtown, than the "New Jersey barriers should be the golden standard" for the protection of cyclists and pedestrians.

      New Jersey barriers are concrete walls that separate vehicles and cyclists. </p>


    <p>  Tristan Haas who also serves on the budget, education, and city services committee also believes that bike lanes benefit both cyclist and pedestrians. He says, "I think that [cyclists and pedestrians] should learn to co-exist despite the fact that it's not an ideal setup. There's also a lot of other benefits that those bike lanes confer, including shorting crossing distances" for pedestrians. </p>
