pich for data story #2
I will be exploring through data the rate in which high school students have felt sad or hopeless, seriously considered attempting suicide 
made a plan about how they would attempt suicide, actually attempted suicide or made as suicide attempt that resulted in an injury, poisoning, or overdose that had to be treated by a doctor or nurse accroding to the CDC, and wheather the rate has increase or decreased since NYS, Virginia, Florida and New Jersey made mental health edducation mandatory.
